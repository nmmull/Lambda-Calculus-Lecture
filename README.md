This repository contains some material for the rough draft of a lecture on the lambda calculus, to be included in a course on the lambda calculus and/or type theory.

*A note on building:* The beamer slides depend on `minted`, which requires the used of the `-shelllatexmk` flag, and depends on `Pygments`.
